We demonstrate that the mechanism underlying this long-standing observation of subclass dominance in function is provided by the differential affinities of IgG subclasses for specific activating IgG Fc receptors compared with their affinities for the inhibitory IgG Fc receptor. The significant differences in the ratios of activating-to-inhibitory receptor binding predicted the in vivo activity. We suggest that these highly predictable functions assigned by Fc binding will be an important consideration in the design of therapeutic antibodies and vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Unconjugated mAbs have emerged as useful cancer therapeutics. Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is believed to be a major antitumor mechanism of some anticancer Abs. However, the factors that regulate the magnitude of ADCC are incompletely understood. In this study, we described the relationship between Ab affinity and ADCC. A series of human IgG1 isotype Abs was created from the anti-HER2/neu (also named c-erbB2) C6.5 single-chain Fv (scFv) and its affinity mutants. The scFv affinities range from 10(-7) to 10(-11) M, and the IgG Abs retain the affinities of the scFv from which they were derived. The apparent affinity of the Abs ranged from nearly 10(-10) M (the lowest affinity variant) to almost 10(-11) M (the other variants). The IgG molecules were tested for their ability to elicit ADCC in vitro against three tumor cell lines with differing levels of HER2/neu expression using unactivated human PBMC from healthy donors as the effector cells. The results demonstrated that both the apparent affinity and intrinsic affinity of the Abs studied regulate ADCC. High-affinity tumor Ag binding by the IgGs led to the most efficient and powerful ADCC. Tumor cells expressing high levels of HER2/neu are more susceptible to the ADCC triggered by Abs than the cells expressing lower amounts of HER2/neu. These findings justify the examination of high affinity Abs for ADCC promotion. Because high affinity may impair in vivo tumor targeting, a careful examination of Ab structure to function relationships is required to develop optimized therapeutic unconjugated Abs.",

Using this method, high-resolution mass spectra were acquired to produce the overall glycosylation profile of the mAb. Additionally, the light and heavy chains from the reduced antibody were separated in the gas phase by the ion mobility functionality of the instrument, allowing accurate mass measurement of each subunit. Furthermore, the glycan sequences, as well as the glycosylation site, were determined by a two-step sequential fragmentation process using the unique dual-collision-cell design of the instrument, thus providing detailed characterizations of the glycan structures.",

    "abstract": "Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms, serve as therapeutics in tumor therapy, and are involved in destruction of healthy tissues during autoimmune diseases. Understanding the molecular pathways and effector cell types involved in antibody-mediated effector functions is a prerequisite to modulate these activities. In this study we used two independent model systems to identify innate immune effector cells required for IgG activity in vivo. We first defined the precise repertoire of receptors for the IgG Fc fragment (FcγR) on innate immune effector cells in the blood and on tissue-resident macrophage populations. Despite expression of relevant activating FcγRs on various phagocyte populations, our data indicate that the majority of these cell types are dispensable for IgG activity in vivo. In contrast, IgG-dependent effector functions were selectively impaired in animals lacking the CX(3)CR1(hi)Ly6C(lo)CD11c(int) monocyte subset, which expressed the full set of FcγRs required for IgG activity.",

    "abstract": "Anti-CD20 Ab therapy has proven successful for treating B cell malignancies and a number of autoimmune diseases. However, how anti-CD20 Abs operate in vivo to mediate B cell depletion is not fully understood. In particular, the anatomical location, the type of effector cells, and the mechanism underlying anti-CD20 therapy remain uncertain. Here, we found that the liver is a major site for B cell depletion and that recirculation accounts for the decrease in B cell numbers observed in secondary lymphoid organs. Using intravital imaging, we established that, upon anti-CD20 treatment, Kupffer cells (KCs) mediate the abrupt arrest and subsequent engulfment of B cells circulating in the liver sinusoids. KCs were also effective in depleting malignant B cells in a model of spontaneous lymphoma. Our results identify Ab-dependent cellular phagocytosis by KCs as a primary mechanism of anti-CD20 therapy and provide an experimental framework for optimizing the efficacy of therapeutic Abs. ",

    "abstract": "Macrophages protect the body from damage and disease by targeting antibody-opsonized cells for phagocytosis. Though antibodies can be raised against antigens with diverse structures, shapes, and sizes, it is unclear why some are more effective at triggering immune responses than others. Here, we define an antigen height threshold that regulates phagocytosis of both engineered and cancer-specific antigens by macrophages. Using a reconstituted model of antibody-opsonized target cells, we find that phagocytosis is dramatically impaired for antigens that position antibodies >10 nm from the target surface. Decreasing antigen height drives segregation of antibody-bound Fc receptors from the inhibitory phosphatase CD45 in an integrin-independent manner, triggering Fc receptor phosphorylation and promoting phagocytosis. Our work shows that close contact between macrophage and target is a requirement for efficient phagocytosis, suggesting that therapeutic antibodies should target short antigens in order to trigger Fc receptor activation through size-dependent physical segregation.",

    "abstract": "Many immune receptors transduce activation across the plasma membrane through their clustering. With Fcγ receptors (FcγRs), this clustering is driven by binding to antibodies of differing affinities that are in turn bound to multivalent antigen. As a consequence of this activation mechanism, accounting for and rationally manipulating immunoglobulin (Ig)G effector function is complicated by, among other factors, differing affinities between FcγR species and changes in the valency of antigen binding. In this study, we show that a model of multivalent receptor-ligand binding can effectively account for the contribution of IgG-FcγR affinity and immune complex valency. This model in turn enables us to make specific predictions about the effect of immune complexes of defined composition. In total, these results enable both rational immune complex design for a desired IgG effector function and the deconvolution of effector function by immune complexes.",

    "abstract": "Mouse IgG3 appears early in immune responses independently of T cell help and, as such, is an early effector molecule of the immune system. Yet, a specific IgG3 cellular receptor remains undefined. In transfection experiments, mouse Fc gammaRI was clearly able to bind immune complexes of IgG3, whereas mouse Fc gammaRII could not. Furthermore, macrophages from mice expressing Fc gammaRII and Fc gammaRIII but lacking Fc gammaRI were unable to phagocytose IgG3 immune complexes, thus identifying mouse Fc gammaRI as the sole receptor for IgG3 immune complexes. Competition studies demonstrated that monomeric mouse IgG3 could inhibit IgG2a binding to mouse Fc gammaRI with an ID50 approximately 10(-7) M (fivefold lower than IgG2a). The identification of mouse Fc gammaRI as the IgG3 receptor establishes Fc gammaRI as a participant in events at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity, implying a greater role for this receptor in the development of normal and pathologic immune responses than previously recognized.",
